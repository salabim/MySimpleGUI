Changelog MySimpleGUI
=====================
vs 1.1.7  2020-09-06
--------------------
In PySimpleGUI the target in several Button functions (like FilesBrowse and FolderBrowse) defaults to the
(ThisRow, -1). When you want it to point to the button itself, you have to specify a target that is equal
to key, k or button_text. In order support the DRY (don't repeat yourself) principle, MySimpleGUI now automatically
points to 'itself' if the target parameter is the null string or None.

Awaiting a bug fix in PySimpleGUI, MySimpleGUI now correctly returns the null string upon pressing
<Cancel> in FileBrowse, FilesBrowse and FolderBrowse.

vs 1.1.6  2020-08-30
--------------------
MySimpleGUI now supports pretty printing of elements, colums and windows. This can be very helpful
in debugging complex layouts.
This is implemented via a __repr__ method of the Element and Window classes.
Printing can be done with an ordinary print.

Note that attributes that are None or (None, None) are suppressed from the output.

In previous versions keys that were equal to one of the internal attributes of the Window class.
like "Rows", "read", "AllKeysDict" were not allowed in MySimpleGUI. That limitation does not exist
anymore.

Technical detail:
    If a key is also used as an internal attribute of Window, e.g. modal,
        window.modal will return the element associated with "modal"
    If the internal attribute is required in that case, so
        window.internal.modal will return the value of the internal attribute window.
    If an internal attribute of a window is not defined as a key of any element in that window,
    e.g. (under the assumption that 'saw_00' is not used as a key)
        window.saw_00 and window.internal.saw_00 will be equivalent.
    In practice however, internal will hardly ever have to be used.    

Internal change: more stable method of detecting which class we are parsing.

vs 1.1.5  2020-08-28
--------------------
The functions to get/set global variables, like sg.message_box_line_width() and sg.button_color() now
provide context manager functionality to temporarily set a global variable, e.g.
    with sg.message_box_line_width(20):
        sg.Popup("Hey, this is much more narrow than usual!")
    sg.Popup("And now it's back to the usual 60 characters width, isn't it?")

Without a parameter, a function still returns the current value:
    print(sg.message_box_line_width())
And you can still set a global variable with
    sg.message_box_line_width(100)
    
Implementation detail: A function with a parameter like sg.message_box_line_width(100) now returns a
TemporaryChange object instead of the current value.

Some minor bug fixes.


vs 1.1.4  2020-08-24
--------------------
Normally, a traceback will just show line numbers and not the line itself in the patched PySimpleGUI source, like:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "c:\Users\Ruud\Dropbox (Personal)\Apps\Python Ruud\MySimpleGUI\test pysimplegui.py", line 23, in <module>
        window.Number14.update("Hallo")
      File "<string>", line 7115, in __getattr__
    AttributeError: 'Number14'
With this version it is possible to get full traceback when an exception is raised, like:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "c:\Users\Ruud\Dropbox (Personal)\Apps\Python Ruud\MySimpleGUI\test pysimplegui.py", line 23, in <module>
        window.Number14.update("Hallo")
      File "c:\Users\Ruud\Dropbox (Personal)\Apps\Python Ruud\MySimpleGUI\PySimpleGUI_patched.py", line 7115, in __getattr__
        raise AttributeError(e) from None
    AttributeError: 'Number14'

This is done by saving a file PySimpleGUI_patched. This way of importing MySimpleGUI is slightly slower.
To enable full traceback, the environment variable MySimpleGUI_full_traceback has to be set to a value
other than the null string.
The easiest way to do that is by putting
    import os
    os.environ["MySimpleGUI_full_traceback"] = "1"
before
    import MySimpleGUI as sg 

Some minor bug fixes.

vs 1.1.3  2020-08-23
--------------------
window.read() now returns also the contents of Text elements in values. Note that this might affect
the numbering of elements that don't have a key.

When a duplicate key is found in a layout, a KeyError will be raised, instead of printing
a warning and substituting the key.

vs 1.1.2  2020-08-22
--------------------
The text 'PySimpleGUI' was printed incorrectly. Fixed.

vs 1.1.1  2020-08-20
--------------------
All warnings.warn messages are now either suppressed (if followed by a PopupError) or 
will raise a RuntimeError Exception with the original message.

vs 1.1.0  2020-08-13
--------------------
Complete change of code. Instead of importing PySimpleGUI, the complete source code is now read from
PySimpleGUI, parsed and patched where required. This is a much more flexible approach that also allows for
future patches to be applied relatively easy.

SUPPRESS_ERROR_POPUPS is now always False, even if you try and set it.

Exception and PopupError handling included.

The generated code can be run as a separate (forked) package, if required.

vs 1.0.1  2020-08-06
--------------------
Renamed to MySimpleGUI

Added functionality:
- functions to get/set the global variables as used in SetOptions
- The function ChangeLookAndFeel or change_look_and_feel as well theme now raises a ValueError
  if a non existing theme is given
- MultiLine now supports ANSI colors and can be used as a file.


vs 1.0.0  2020-07-28
--------------------
Initial version called PySimpleGUI_attributes
